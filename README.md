# Pi-that-folds-your-clothes

So right now This code just runs on a servo if hooked up correctly.

I think this would be a good place to track progress to put it our sprint template. 
so....

I had the thought since we are graded on software, Professor would enjoy seeing software updates at every meeting rather than significant hardware updates with little no software updates. So I added a bit more complexity to the readme to clarify software and hardware

Week 1
=============

### Software ###
  
        ✔️   connect to and control *servos* from pi
  
        ✔️ connect to and control *motors* from pi
  
  
  ### Hardware ###
  
        ✔️  Get a servo running. 
   
        ✔️  Watched and studied this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fdwE4EznYo
  
        ✔️  Picked a motor that would be suffiecient for our project(finally)


Week 2 - Meeting Week
=============
  ### Software ###
  
        ✔️ control RPM's
  
        ✔️ turn 180 degrees and back
        
        [ ] Connect to and display text
        
  
  
  ### Hardware ###
  
        ✔️  connect motor to h bridge to pi
  
        ✔️  connect 2 motors to H bridge
   
        [ ]  connect 2M to one H Bridge and 1M to another H Bridge
  
        [ ]  connect motors to platforms
